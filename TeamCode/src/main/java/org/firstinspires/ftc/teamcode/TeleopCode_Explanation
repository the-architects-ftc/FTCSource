Simple Mecanum TeleOp Code Explanation
This guide explains how the provided TeleOp code works and how to configure your robot in the FTC Driver Station.

Code Logic (Pseudocode)
Define Motors:

The program declares four motors corresponding to the four wheels: Back Left (BL), Front Left (FL), Front Right (FR), Back Right (BR).
Initialize Hardware:

Motors are linked to the configuration names defined in the FTC Driver Station (e.g., "LB" for Back Left Motor).
Set Motor Directions:

To make the robot move correctly, the left-side motors (LB, LF) are reversed while the right-side motors (RF, RB) are set to forward.
Gamepad Input:

The program reads joystick inputs from the Gamepad:
Left Stick Y: Forward/Backward movement.
Left Stick X: Side-to-side strafing.
Right Stick X: Rotation.
Calculate Motor Power:

Uses mecanum wheel formulas to calculate power for each wheel:
BL Power = Forward/Backward + Strafing + Rotation
FL Power = Forward/Backward - Strafing + Rotation
BR Power = Forward/Backward - Strafing - Rotation
FR Power = Forward/Backward + Strafing - Rotation
Set Power to Motors:

The calculated power values are assigned to the respective motors, enabling movement in all directions.
Telemetry:

Displays motor power values on the Driver Station for debugging purposes.
Step-by-Step Robot Configuration Guide
Open the FTC Driver Station Configuration:

Launch the FTC Driver Station app on your phone.
Go to the "Configure Robot" section.
Add Motors to the Configuration:

Add four motors and name them exactly as follows:
LB: Back Left motor.
LF: Front Left motor.
RF: Front Right motor.
RB: Back Right motor.
Set Motor Directions:

Assign motor directions:
LB and LF: Set to REVERSE.
RF and RB: Set to FORWARD.
Connect Motors to the REV Hub:

Connect the motors to the correct ports on the REV Hub.
Ensure the ports match the configuration.
Test Motor Movement:

Once the code is uploaded to your robot, test the controls to ensure:
Joystick movements correspond to the expected robot movement (forward, backward, strafing, rotation).
